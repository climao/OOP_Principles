/**
 * A base class to ilustrate abstract classes.
 *
 * Data abstraction focuses on hiding the class implementation details from its users.
 *
 * The "abstract" keyword can be used with either classes or methods:
 *   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (i.e. used to create objects).
 *   - An abstract method (used in abstract classes only) is a method that doesn't have a body and should be
 *     implemented by a subclass.
