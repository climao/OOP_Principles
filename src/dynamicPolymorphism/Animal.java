/**
 * A base class to ilustrate dynamic polymorphism.
 *
 *  Also known as runtime polymorphism, because the decision on which method to invoke is made during runtime.
 *  This is achieved by using method overriding. When a method is called through a reference variable of a superclass,
 *  the determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred.
